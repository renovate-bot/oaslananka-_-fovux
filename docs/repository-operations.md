# Repository Operations

## Dual-owner repository model

This repository uses a dual-owner model:
- `oaslananka/fovux` is the canonical public repository. It consumes **zero** GitHub Actions minutes.
- `oaslananka-lab/fovux` is the protected CI/CD and release repository.

Changes land through reviewed pull requests. Direct branch replay and tag rewriting are intentionally disabled.

## Disable Actions defensively on personal repo

```bash
# Disable Actions entirely on the personal repo
gh api -X PUT /repos/oaslananka/fovux/actions/permissions \
  -f enabled=false

# Re-enable later if needed:
gh api -X PUT /repos/oaslananka/fovux/actions/permissions \
  -f enabled=true -f allowed_actions=all
```

## Branch hygiene

The canonical repo should have "Automatically delete head branches" enabled:
```bash
gh api -X PATCH /repos/oaslananka/fovux -f delete_branch_on_merge=true
```

Use the branch hygiene report workflow to review old branches before deleting them.
